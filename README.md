By analyzing the data for hit songs in 2023, we found that a song's success mainly depends on three things: whether it gets on the charts, which platform it's popular on, and if people hear it out in the real world. Generally, Spotify is the most important platform, and getting on official charts or becoming popular on Shazam are both effective ways to increase streams.

1. cross_platform
Our scatter plot shows that the more official charts a song appears on, the higher its total streams tend to be. This indicates that being on a chart brings real traffic. But there are exceptions. Super hits like "Shape of You" have massive stream counts even if they aren't on the most charts, showing that their quality has won over listeners directly.

2. streams_vs_chartcount
Looking at the cross-platform comparison, almost all hit songs are included in far more playlists on Spotify than on Apple Music or Deezer.
This suggests that Spotify's playlist ecosystem has the biggest influence and is the core channel for a song's distribution.

3. shazam_platform_matrix
The matrix chart tells us that if a song is popular on Shazam (meaning many people are identifying it with their phones in public), its stream count on Spotify is usually also very high.
This means that if a song can become popular in offline settings, it has a very high chance of succeeding online.

Final Summary
In short, our data analysis leads to three basic conclusions: 

i, Charts are important: Being on a chart effectively increases streams.

ii, Platforms are important: Spotify is the main stage for a song to become a hit.

iii, Offline promotion is important: A song that's hot on Shazam will almost certainly do well online.

iv, A true hit song is an "all-rounder" that performs well in all these areas.
